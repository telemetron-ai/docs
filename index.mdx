## What is Telemetron?

Telemetron is an AI-powered customer support platform designed specifically for hardware companies. It uses **telemetry data from your devices** to diagnose customer issues intelligently and provide exceptional support experiences through automated insights.

<Info>
  **For Hardware Companies**: These APIs allow you to keep your customer and device data synchronized with Telemetron. By maintaining this sync, Telemetron can automatically correlate telemetry data with the right customers and devices, enabling faster diagnosis and resolution of support issues.

## Core Capabilities

### Customer Management

Keep your customer data synchronized with Telemetron:

- **Create or Update Customers** - Sync customer records from your systems to Telemetron
- **Query by Email** - Quickly find customers using their email address
- **Retrieve Customer Details** - Get complete customer information including device assignments
- **Auto-Creation** - Automatically create customer records during device assignments

### Device Ownership Tracking

Maintain accurate device-to-customer mappings so Telemetron knows which telemetry belongs to which customer:

- **Assign Devices** - Link devices to one or multiple customer owners
- **Unassign Devices** - Remove device assignments when ownership changes
- **Auto-Create Devices** - Optionally create device records on the fly
- **Device History** - Track the complete ownership history of each device

<Warning>
  **Why Sync Matters**: When your devices send telemetry data to Telemetron, the platform uses the device-to-customer mappings you maintain via these APIs to automatically associate telemetry with the correct customers. This enables Telemetron to provide intelligent, context-aware support.
</Warning>

### Telemetry-Driven Support

Telemetron leverages device telemetry to provide intelligent support:

- **Automatic Issue Detection** - Telemetry data reveals device problems before customers report them
- **Contextual Diagnosis** - Correlate device behavior with customer and usage context
- **Proactive Support** - Reach out to customers before small issues become big problems
- **Data-Driven Insights** - Understand patterns across your device fleet

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Telemetry-Based Support">
    When your devices send telemetry to Telemetron, the platform automatically identifies which customer owns the device and can provide intelligent support. Keep device assignments current so telemetry is always mapped to the right customer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product Registration & Onboarding">
    When customers register their devices, sync this information to Telemetron so that any telemetry data from that device is immediately associated with the correct customer account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Warranty and Support Management">
    Maintain accurate device ownership records so Telemetron can provide targeted support based on both telemetry data and customer history.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Family and Shared Devices">
    Assign devices to multiple owners (family members, team members) so all relevant parties receive support notifications when telemetry indicates issues.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Device Transfer">
    Update device ownership when products are resold or reassigned, ensuring telemetry data and support communications go to the current owner.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
