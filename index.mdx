## What This API Does

Telemetron provides AI-powered support for hardware companies. This API lets you sync three things:

1. **Devices** - Your hardware products that send telemetry
2. **Customers** - Your end users who own devices
3. **Device Assignments** - Mappings that connect devices to customers

When devices send telemetry to Telemetron, we use these mappings to identify which customer owns the device and provide intelligent support.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Devices

**What they are**: Your hardware products (thermostats, sensors, gateways, etc.) that send telemetry data to Telemetron.

**Device Identifier**: Each device has a unique identifier (serial number, MAC address, etc.) that you define.

**Device Type**: A label describing the device category (e.g., "Thermostat", "Sensor", "Gateway").

**In the API**: Devices are referenced by their `deviceIdentifier`. Device are created lazily through assignment to customers with `autoCreateDevice: true`.

### 2. Customers

**What they are**: Your end users who own or operate devices.

**Key identifier**: Email address (unique per organization).

**Customer ID**: After creation, each customer gets a unique `telemetronCustomerId`.

**In the API**: 
- [Create or update customers](/api-reference/customer/create-or-update)
- [Query by email](/api-reference/customer/query)
- [Get by ID](/api-reference/customer/get-by-id)

### 3. Device Assignments

**What they are**: Mappings that connect devices to customers.

**Purpose**: When a device sends telemetry, Telemetron uses these mappings to identify the customer and provide support.

**Multi-owner support**: A single device can be assigned to multiple customers (family accounts, shared devices).

**In the API**:
- [Assign device to customers](/api-reference/device/assign-device)
- [Unassign device from customer](/api-reference/device/unassign-device)

<Tip>
  **Flow**: Device sends telemetry → Telemetron looks up assignment → Identifies customer → Provides AI-powered support
</Tip>

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    Log into [Dashboard](https://admin.telemetron.ai) → Settings → API Keys → Generate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Customer Records">
    Use [Create/Update Customer](/api-reference/customer/create-or-update) to sync your customer database
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign Devices to Customers">
    Use [Assign Device](/api-reference/device/assign-device) to create device-to-customer mappings
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Telemetry Routes Automatically">
    When devices send telemetry, Telemetron automatically identifies the customer and provides AI support

## Common Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Customer buys a device" icon="cart-shopping">
    1. Customer completes purchase in your system
    2. Call [Create Customer](/api-reference/customer/create-or-update) (if new customer)
    3. Call [Assign Device](/api-reference/device/assign-device) with `autoCreateDevice: true` and `deviceType`
    4. ✅ Telemetry from this device now routes to this customer
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Customer sells device to someone else" icon="right-left">
    1. Call [Unassign Device](/api-reference/device/unassign-device) with old owner's email
    2. Call [Create Customer](/api-reference/customer/create-or-update) for new owner (if needed)
    3. Call [Assign Device](/api-reference/device/assign-device) with new owner's email
    4. ✅ Telemetry now routes to new owner
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Family shares a device" icon="users">
    1. Ensure all family members exist as customers
    2. Call [Assign Device](/api-reference/device/assign-device) with array of all family member emails
    3. ✅ All family members receive support alerts for this device
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Query customer's devices" icon="magnifying-glass">
    1. Call [Query Customer](/api-reference/customer/query) with email
    2. Response includes `devices` array with all assigned device identifiers
    3. ✅ See all devices owned by this customer
  </Accordion>
