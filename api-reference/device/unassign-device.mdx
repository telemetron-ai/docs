## Overview

This endpoint removes a device assignment from a specific customer. The device and customer records remain in the system, but the association between them is removed.

<Warning>

## Status Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 200 | Device successfully unassigned from customer |
| 400 | Invalid request (missing required fields, invalid email format, or device not assigned to customer) |
| 401 | Invalid or missing API key |
| 404 | Customer not found in your organization |
| 500 | Internal server error |

## Notes

- **Email validation**: The endpoint validates email format before processing
- **Customer persistence**: The customer record is not deleted, only the device assignment is removed
- **Device persistence**: The device record remains in the system
- **Remaining devices**: The response includes a list of devices still assigned to the customer, allowing you to track their current device inventory
- **Non-destructive**: This operation only removes the association; it does not delete the device or customer records

## Use Cases

- **Device returns**: When a customer returns or replaces a device, unassign it so telemetry is no longer routed to them
- **Warranty transfers**: When transferring a device warranty to a different customer, unassign from the old owner first
- **Device ownership changes**: When a device is transferred from one customer to another (unassign from old owner, then assign to new owner)
- **Account cleanup**: When removing old or inactive devices from a customer's account

<Tip>
  **Device Transfers**: To transfer a device from one customer to another, first call this unassign endpoint, then immediately call the [Assign Device](/api-reference/device/assign-device) endpoint with the new owner's email. This ensures telemetry is routed to the correct customer without any gaps.
