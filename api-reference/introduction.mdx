## Telemetron External API (ext-v1)

Synchronize customer and device ownership data to enable Telemetron to correlate device telemetry with customers for AI-powered support.

## Base URL

```
https://admin.telemetron.ai/api/ext-v1
```

## Authentication

All requests require an API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

**Get your API key**: Dashboard → Settings → API Keys → Generate

<Warning>Never expose API keys in client-side code or commit them to version control.</Warning>

## Endpoints

### Customer Management
- `POST /customer/createOrUpdateCustomer` - Create or update customer records
- `POST /customer/queryCustomer` - Query customer by email
- `GET /customer/getCustomer/{id}` - Get customer by ID

### Device Assignment
- `POST /deviceAssignment/assignDeviceToOwners` - Assign device to one or more customers
- `POST /deviceAssignment/unassignDeviceFromOwner` - Remove device assignment

<Tip>Keep mappings synchronized. Update Telemetron immediately when customers register devices or transfer ownership.</Tip>

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Success responses include `success: true`, error responses include `error` field.

**Success:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed",
  "data": { }
}
```

**Error:**
```json

```

## HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning |

## How Device-Customer Mapping Works

1. **Device sends telemetry** → Telemetron receives device data
2. **Mapping lookup** → Uses your synced mappings to identify the customer
3. **AI diagnosis** → Analyzes telemetry in customer context
4. **Intelligent support** → Provides proactive support or alerts your team

**Bottom line**: Keep mappings current so telemetry reaches the right customers.
