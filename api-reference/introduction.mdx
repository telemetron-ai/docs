## Welcome to Telemetron API

The Telemetron External API (ext-v1) provides programmatic access to synchronize customer and device data with Telemetron. This API is designed for **hardware companies** who use Telemetron's AI-powered support platform.

<Info>
  **Why these APIs exist**: Telemetron uses telemetry data from your devices to diagnose customer issues intelligently. These APIs allow you to keep customer and device ownership information synchronized with Telemetron, enabling the platform to automatically correlate incoming telemetry with the correct customers and provide context-aware support.
</Info>

## Base URL

```
https://admin.telemetron.ai/api/ext-v1
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

### Getting Your API Key

1. Log into your Telemetron dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Generate a new API key for your organization

<Warning>
  Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

## API Overview

The Telemetron API is organized around REST principles and consists of two main resource groups:

### Customer Management
Sync your customer data with Telemetron so the platform knows who your customers are when their devices send telemetry:
- Create or update customers
- Query customers by email
- Retrieve customer details by ID

### Device Assignment
Maintain device-to-customer mappings so Telemetron can associate telemetry data with the correct customer accounts:
- Assign devices to customer owners
- Unassign devices from customer owners

<Warning>
  **Keep Data Synchronized**: For Telemetron to provide accurate, intelligent support, it's essential to keep your customer and device mappings up-to-date. When a customer registers a device, transfers ownership, or makes account changes, sync these updates to Telemetron immediately.
</Warning>

## Response Format

All API responses return JSON with consistent structure:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": { }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error description"
}
```

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your devices send telemetry">
    Your hardware devices send telemetry data (metrics, logs, events) to Telemetron's telemetry ingestion endpoints.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Telemetron maps telemetry to customers">
    Using the device-to-customer mappings you maintain via these APIs, Telemetron identifies which customer owns each device sending telemetry.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI-powered diagnosis">
    Telemetron's AI analyzes the telemetry data in the context of the customer, device history, and patterns to diagnose issues intelligently.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Intelligent support">
    Telemetron provides proactive support, automated responses, or alerts your support team with actionable insights about customer issues.
